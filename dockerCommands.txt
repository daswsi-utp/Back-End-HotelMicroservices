FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T EXECUTE MVN INSIDE THE DOCKERFILES THEMSELVES SO TYPE MANUALLY FROM ROOT:
mvn clean package -DskipTests
(In root)
docker build -f MODULE_NAME/Dockerfile -t MODULE_NAME . (To create the image)
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh MODULE_NAME (To enter the docker bash itself)
-> ls -l /app (to see if .jar files were created inside the image)
docker run -p PORT:PORT MODULE_NAME (To run the docker image)
